### Phase 4 — Admin Dashboard

Branch: `claude/phase1-stability` · Commit: `feat(phase-4): admin dashboard — auth gate, rooms, reports, cleanup`

#### Added
- `src/admin.js`: complete admin dashboard implementation (~567 lines)
- `/admin` route now renders a full dashboard instead of a placeholder
- Supabase Auth gate requiring email and password before any dashboard data loads
- `is_syncpad_admin()` RLS function gates all Supabase queries so non-admins receive no data
- **Rooms tab**: displays the 50 latest rooms with client-side search and flag badges (`ENC`, `PASS`, `1×`, `EXP`); per-room Clear and Delete actions
- **Reports tab**: displays the 100 latest reports; "show only new" checkbox filter; per-report Dismiss and Delete-room actions
- **Cleanup tab**: one-click invocation of `run_cleanup_expired_syncpad_rooms_as_admin()` RPC with manual-delete fallback and result display
- Stat cards showing total rooms, active rooms, total files, and pending reports
- Human-readable error message for Supabase `PGRST301` (insufficient privileges)

### Phase 3 — Templates Library v2

Branch: `claude/phase1-stability` · Commit: `feat(phase-3): Templates Library v2`

#### Added
- 6 new built-in templates: `standup`, `bug-report`, `code-review`, `weekly-review`, `shopping-list`, `project-brief` (total now 13, up from ~7)
- Each template exposes `label`, `desc` (subtitle), and `body` fields
- Templates modal v2: searchable input, two-column layout with list pane and live preview pane
- Export custom templates as a JSON file
- Import custom templates from a JSON file via `importCustomTemplates(json)`, which returns the count of imported templates or `-1` on invalid input
- `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` storage error is now surfaced to the user (was previously silent)
- `BODY_MAX = 50,000` character limit enforced for custom template bodies

#### Changed
- `saveCustomTemplate()` now returns `{ key, truncated }` instead of just `key`, so callers can detect when the body was silently trimmed

---

### Phase 2 — Accessibility & Polish

Branch: `claude/phase1-stability` · Commit: `feat(phase-2): accessibility, theme transitions, expiration validation, confirm modal`

#### Added
- `role="list"` on `#files-list` and `#devices-list`; `role="listitem"` on their child elements
- `aria-label="Preview {filename}"`, `aria-label="Download {filename}"`, and `aria-label="Delete {filename}"` on file list action buttons
- `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative emoji inside file list items
- CSS theme transitions: `background-color`, `border-color`, and `color` transition over `0.22s ease` on `body`, panels, and modals (buttons are excluded to avoid sluggish click feedback)
- Custom `showConfirm(message, { confirmLabel, cancelLabel, danger })` modal returning `Promise<boolean>`
  - Injected lazily into the DOM with `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`
  - `danger: true` moves default focus to the Cancel button
  - Escape key closes the modal and resolves `false`

#### Changed
- Minimum expiration duration enforced at 5 minutes (300 seconds) inside `_buildExpirationDuration()`
- All `window.confirm()` calls replaced with the new `showConfirm()` modal

#### Fixed
- Shortcuts modal legal links were rendered outside the `.modal` dialog element; they are now correctly placed inside it

### Phase 1 — Stability

Branch: `claude/phase1-stability` · Commit: `fix(phase-1): stability, focus, loading states, URL cache, CSV hardening`

#### Fixed
- `_relativeTime()` was producing `"Invalid Date"` in the conflict banner due to missing timestamp coercion; sync timestamps are now coerced to numbers before use
- PWA install bar dismiss state was not persisted across page loads
- `formatTimestamp()` cross-day context bug caused incorrect date labels when the current day and the document's last-modified day differed
- `wireEvents()` was appending new DOM event listeners on every room navigation without removing the previous ones, causing a memory leak; listeners are now torn down before re-attachment
- Markdown renderer was double-escaping URLs (e.g. `%2520` instead of `%20`)
- Markdown italic regex was matching underscores inside `snake_case` words; word-boundary guards added
- Find & Replace search state was not reset when navigating to a different room
- `copyToClipboard()` in the share modal was broken and now functions correctly
- Stale `_expTimer` from a previous room was firing in the context of the newly loaded room
- `_encKey` and `_encSalt` were not cleared on room navigation, causing encryption state to leak across rooms
- `_markdownMode`, `_showPreview`, and `_expPreset` were not reset on room navigation

#### Removed
- Dead `_getPresenceDevices()` function (unreachable code)
- Dead `broadcastExpired()` function (unreachable code)

#### Added
- Signed URL cache in `files.js`: a `Map` with a 55-minute TTL, automatically evicted when a file is deleted, eliminating redundant Supabase Storage signing requests
- CSV table rendering hardened against malformed input

---

### Phase 0 — CSS Grid & Find/Replace Focus

Branch: `claude/phase1-stability` · Commit: `refactor: CSS Grid editor layout + Find & Replace focus preservation`

#### Changed
- `.editor-wrap` layout migrated from flexbox to CSS Grid using `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(100%, 400px), 1fr))` for responsive multi-pane behaviour

#### Fixed
- Find & Replace inputs lost focus after each keystroke during live search; focus is now preserved correctly throughout search operations
